After startup, a software interface pops up with a screenshot button. 

Clicking the button, I can select the area on the screen. 

After the selection is complete,

The selection area is pinned to the top layer of the screen by default, with a red border.

Clicking on the pinned image on the screen allows you to drag it, 

and right clicking on the image allows you to choose to destroy it.
